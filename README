== What is Serve?

Serve is a small Ruby script that makes it easy to start up an HTTP server
in any directory. This is ideal for everything from HTML prototyping to simple
file sharing.

== Usage

At a command prompt all you need to type to start serve is:

$ serve

This will launch a WEBrick server which you can access from any Web browser at
the following address:

http://localhost:3000

Once the server is going it will output a running log of its activity. To
stop the server at any time, type CTRL+C at the command prompt. By default the
serve command serves up files from the current directory. To change this
behavior, `cd` to the appropriate directory before starting serve.


== Advanced Options

The serve command automatically binds to 0.0.0.0 (localhost) and uses port
3000. To serve files over a different IP (that is bound to your computer) or
port you can specify those options on the command line:

$ serve 4000               # a custom port

$ serve 192.168.1.6        # a custom IP

$ serve 192.168.1.6:4000   # a custom IP and port


== Rails Applications

For your convenience if the file "script/server" exists in the current
directory the serve command will start that instead of launching a WEBrick
server. You can specify the environment that you want to start the server
with as an option on the command line:

$ serve production         # start script/server in production mode
