What is this?
=============

This is a simple HTML prototype written in HAML or ERB that is designed to be
viewed with Serve.

What is Serve? Serve is a rapid prototyping framework for Rails applications.
It is designed to compliment Rails development and enforce a strict separation
of concerns between designer and developer. Using Serve with Rails allows the
designer to happily work in his own space creating an HTML prototype of the
application, while the developer works on the Rails application and copies
over HTML from the prototype as needed. This allows the designer to focus on
presentation and flow while the developer can focus on the implementation.


How do I install and run Serve?
-------------------------------

Serve is distributed as a gem to make it easy to get up and running. To
install:

     % sudo gem install serve

This will startup serve on port 4000. You can now view the prototype in your
Web browser at this URL:

     http://localhost:4000

Click around. You will find that Serve enables you to prototype most
functionality without writing a single line of backend code.


Rack and Passenger
------------------

If you look around you will quickly notice that this is also a simple Rack
application so it is easy to deploy it on Passenger or Rack it up with the
`rackup` command. For more information about using Serve and Passenger see:
