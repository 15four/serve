<% @title = "Creating a New Serve Project" %>

<p>For simple projects, you donâ€™t need to structure your files in a
specific way. All ERB, Haml, and Sass files will be processed wherever they
are found in the project root. But for more complex projects you may want
to use Serve with a `config.ru` file so that you can take advantage of
other Rack middleware and structure the project in a Rack compatible way.</p>

<p>To create a new Rack-based Serve project in the "project" directory, type
the following on the command line:</p>

<pre>serve create project   # create a new project in the project directory</pre>

<p>This will create a new project with the following directory structure:</p>

<pre>project/
  |
  +-- config.ru              # Rack configuration file
  |
  +-- compass.config         # Compass configuration file
  |
  +-- public/                # Directories for static assets
  |    |
  |    +-- stylesheets/      # Compiled stylesheets
  |    |
  |    +-- images/
  |    |
  |    `-- javascripts/
  |
  +-- stylesheets/           # Sass and SCSS source files
  |    |
  |    `-- application.scss  # Example SCSS file for application
  |
  +-- tmp/                   # Needed for Passenger (mod_passenger)
  |    |
  |    `-- restart.txt
  |
  `-- views/                 # Store your ERB, Haml, etc. here
       |
       +-- _layout.html.erb  # Example layout
       |
       +-- hello.html.erb    # Example view
       |
       +-- index.redirect    # Example redirect
       |
       `-- view_helpers.rb   # Example view helpers</pre>

<p>If you would like to generate the project with a specific JavaScript
framework you can do so with the <kbd>-j</kbd> flag:</p>

<pre>serve create mockups -j prototype</pre>

<p>Available frameworks are: <kbd>jquery</kbd>, <kbd>jquery-ui</kbd>,
<kbd>mootools</kbd>, <kbd>prototype</kbd>, and <kbd>scriptaculous</kbd>.</p>

<p>The `serve create` command can be executed multiple times or on an existing
project without negative consequences.</p>
